# vuejs-riverflow

Vue.js based riverflow app

Testing out vuejs for the first time by converting on old jquery based app. Select a river to get the latest flow in cubic feet per second along with a 7-day graph, paddling description, and saved history of searches.

This publishes to docs/ for gh-pages. [View the app](https://mountaindrawn.com/riverflow/#/).
